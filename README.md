# IdentifyGender
Python code to identify a gender given a first name for the person.

*. SimpleImplementation.py -  A simple piece of python code which classifies first names based on the idea that most names end with the vowels 'a', 'e' or 'i'. Though the 'confidence' of this method is low , it is easy and fast to implement and works just fine for most Indian names.

Assumption : We just have access to the first name and nothing else. 

Source : Coded based on inputs from [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-phonetic-linguistic-difference-between-male-and-female-names)

*. FromDatasets.py - We can filter the first names from large datasets with high confidence. On the downside, it will work only if the names are present in the dataset.

Assumption: The names entered cater to country codes and the names available in the dataset are considered for gender classification.
